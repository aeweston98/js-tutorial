# js-tutorial

## Motivation
I wanted to gain some experience with web development and the associated tools.
Specifically I am using (and learning) **Node.js, MongoDB and HTML/CSS**.
To make things interesting I am going to use the **Spotify WebAPI** to make a playlist manager to fill some of the features that are automatic with Apple Music and other services.
